  <p>Art has been a part of me since I was really little and I did not know how to draw inside the lines. I was born in Venezuela but raised in the Caribbean, in a beautiful island called St. Lucia. I come from a crazy household, my dad was born Syrian and my mom Colombian. I have traveled and moved around quite a lot and I believe it has had a great influenced in my work. I lived in various parts of the USA and in Spain. Right now I have settled down in Miami since I decided to pursue my career as a visual artist.
